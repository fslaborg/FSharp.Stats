"FSharp.Stats provides a wide range of probability distributions. Given the\n",
"distribution parameters they can be used to investigate their statistical properties\n",
"or to sample non-uniform random numbers.\n",
"\n",
"For every distribution the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative probability function (CDF) can be accessed.\n",
"By using the PDF you can access the probability for exactly X=k success states. The CDF is used when the cumulative probabilities of X\u0026lt;=k is required.\n",
"\n",
"## Continuous\n",

"### Normal distribution\n",
"\n",
"The normal or Gaussian distribution is a very common continuous probability distribution.\n",
"Due to the central limit theorem, randomly sampled means of a random and independent distribution tend to approximate a normal distribution\n",
"It describes the probability, that under a given mean and\n",
"a given dispersion (standard deviation) an event occurs exactly k times.\n",
"\n",
"It is defined by two parameters N(mu,tau):\n",
"\n",
"* mu = mean\n",
"  \n",
"\n",
"* tau = standard deviation\n",

"The F-distribution has two independent degrees of freedom(dof) as parameters, and thus forms a two-parameter distribution family.\n",
"\n",
"Generally speaking, the F-tests and the resulting F-Distribution is utilized for comparing multiple levels of independent variables with multiple groups.\n",
