"\n",
"The H-test is also known as Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis-of-variance-by-ranks and is the non-parametric equivalent of one-way ANOVA.\n",
"It is a non-parametric test for comparing the means of more than two independent samples (equal or different sample size), and therefore is an extension of Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney two sample test.\n",
"Testing with H test gives information whether the samples are from the same distribution.\n",
"\n",
"A benefit of the H-test is that it does not require normal distribution of the samples.\n",
"The downside is that there is no information which samples are different from each other, or how many differences occur. For further investigation a post hoc test is recommended.\n",
"\n",
"The distribution of the H-test statistic is approximated by chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom = sample count - 1.\n",
"\n",
"The implemented H-test is testing for duplicate values in the data.\n",
"Duplicates lead to ties in the ranking, and are corrected by using a correction factor.\n",
